          A master of arcane arts and a strategic thinker, he navigates the game's challenges with
          intelligence and a deep ethical compass. Despite his emotional

    god: Bhal,
    description: `Orin is cruel and sadistic, but artistic and creative in her own twisted way. 
    Her demeanour is immature and almost childish; Orin easily loses her composure when things do not go her way, 
    enacts small rebellions against the authority figures in her life, and enjoys, in a arguably playful way, toying with her victims.
    She derives sadistic pleasure from taunting her victims with the gory details of her deeds.`,
    godDescription: `Bhaal is the God of Murder, a member of the Dead Three and the progenitor of all Bhaalspawn who are his children. He is associated with the domain of Death. Bhaal cannot be the deity of a player Cleric.`,

Despite his humble beginnings, Gortash quickly rose through the ranks of society in Baldur's Gate with great cunning. Now, an influential figure and poised to become the Archduke of the city, he seeks to consolidate his power and become the ruler of the city and beyond, through whatever means are necessary.`,
