<!-- ABOUT THE AUTHOR -->

## About The AUthor

This phenomenal Project was written by me (Miriam) with the everloving help of Stackoverflow. <br\>
What new things did I learn while making this?

- How to use styled components
- How use the drag n drop kit
- How to use the Accordion library
- How to use States the way they're intended to (turns out, not EVERYTHING needs to be in a state)

Theres many sites with info about BG3. What is so special about this? <br\>
Well besides the fact that I made this with my own hands, sweat, tears and blood - it's also the only website I know of that provides you with a party member comparison and party recommendation based on your pick.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Idk about you but I'm an advant gamer, so when it comes to finding a socially well accepted topic to Infodump about I'll usually go for this one.
Since the hype around Baldurs Gate 3 can't be denied and I, myself, am hip-deep into my fourth run trying to explore every pebble of Faerun and it's lively world
full of wonderful stories, characters and places, I couldn't think of a better topic to practice my react skills on. <br/>
In this project you'll find an Intro to the game, an introduction to all of the relevant Origincharacters, a companion-compare section, a FAQ that (hopefully)
answers all of your questions, the who-is-who of murderous-god-chosens as well as a partybuilder that can help you find and build a balanced party for your best
playing experience and a Quiz to tell you how ready you are for your travels through Faerun.
